## Creating Groups Assignment

An teacher has a list of students found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/achapkowski/AS.430.618/gh-pages/lessons/data/assignment_01/class.txt), and would like to create a Python script to help them create equal groups with the sizes between 2 to 6 students.  

Create a program to allow the teacher to specify the size of the groups and randomly select the students.  This should all be done using the **standard** library.  No 3rd party modules allowed.
